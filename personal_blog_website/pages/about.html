                    <h3>My Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>So you want to know the behind the scenes? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    I used to live in Vietnam, and when I came back to Australia I went through a scary process of establishing myself back into my old life.
                    I was a bit lost and bit lonely. One day, I worked past a bouldering gym and found it interestin but didn't think beyond that. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    That night however, I came across a video of Alex Honnold and his free solo of El'Captian. I was hooked! The thought of absolutely losing yourself to a physical climbing problem
                    sounded like a relief. Within that week, I turned up to a gym and started climbing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    That year COVID hit, and our lives came to a frozen stand still. This, did not waiver my interest in climbing but only strenghened it.
                    Now...all I want to do is share what I learnt and hopefully have a few readers write me back and tell me about their journeys.
