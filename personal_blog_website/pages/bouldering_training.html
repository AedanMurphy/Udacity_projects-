                <h3>How to Improve & Progress Forward</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Climb, it is as simple as that. Just climb as much as you can in week. But I found that there were a few important factors to truely became
                    skilled at climbing: <br>
                    <br>
                    Firstly, its a training routine. You need the flexibility, the bone strength and the muscles. Climbing helps you bend your body in a way that becomes
                    natural with time but to climb flawlessly, like an ape you to push your body even further than a climbing session.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Secondly, you need a good pair of shoes, you can start with a basic, all-round pair, and then eventually you can purchase shoes that are more specific to
                    a certain route. You will noticed from the time you start climbing with a good pair of shoes that you stand on the smallest of foot-holds, ankle-hook with 
                    friction and flag without slipping.<br>
                    <br>
                    The final point is.... and this is what stumped my progress, is to not hesitat to go for the harder climbs. I have had friend join a gym for the first time, to find them
                    challenging courses that are way above their abilities. But they progressed by putting themselves in a position that I wouldn't get because I stuck to a easier grade.
